# cassava_desease_classification
=================================

Cassava plant is an important source of food in the world. 
Unfortunately, this plant is vulnerable to a number of viruses.

In this project, we fine tune a pretrained VGGNet trained on ImageNet 
to identify whether a given plant is healthy or not, and if not, which 
kind of viral infection it has.
